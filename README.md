# CovidAlerts-PE project: tweets notifications about COVID-19 for Perú


## What is CovidAlerts-PE?
CovidAlerts-PE is a personal project by @angelmottap with the purpose of process official data about COVID-19 in Perú which is daily shared by the Ministry of Health from Perú (MINSA) through a public platform called "Datos Abiertos".

## Why CovidAlerts-PE?
My original goal with this project was start learning the Go programming language. I wanted to start with something simple to build to learn a long the process.
At the beginning I didn't know what to build but one of my best friends @jvegar gave me an idea to consume public data. In that process of thinking about what kind of data would be interesting to me consume I find that would be useful process data about COVID-19 in my country Perú. Despite having passed 1 year, I see that my country is still far from ending this pandemic.  
One thing we can do is keep us informed about the COVID-19 situation and take awareness about the risks we assume when we go out (especially if we go out with no need). In that sense I find important share simple and useful information to know what is the current COVID-19 situation.  
I see some website and twitter accounts sharing a lot of information about COVID-19 that I find confusing (not only for me), CovidAlerts-PE project help with this issue sharing daily two simple and useful data:  
- Number of people confirmed with COVID-19  
- Number of people deceased
